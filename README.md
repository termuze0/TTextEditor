## 3. Functional Requirements

### Aim of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to study and implement various data structures and algorithms (DSA) through the development of a feature-rich text editor.

### 3.1 Core Features

- **Undo/Redo**: Stack-based functionality to revert and reapply actions, demonstrating stack data structure.
  
- **Search**:
  - **Naive Search**: Basic substring search.
  - **Boyer-Moore**: Efficient substring searching algorithm.
  - **KMP**: Advanced substring searching algorithm.

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Use regular expressions to identify and highlight keywords, comments, and strings.

- **Auto-Completion**: Implement a trie-based system for efficient code and text suggestions.

- **Text Wrapping**: Line break algorithm to fit text within the editor's width.

- **Find and Replace**:
  - **Naive Approach**: Basic find and replace functionality.
  - **Finite State Machine**: Advanced search and replace operations.
  - **Rabin-Karp**: Efficient substring matching for replacements.

- **Spell Checking**: Utilize Levenshtein Distance for determining word similarity and suggesting corrections.

- **File I/O**: Implement efficient buffer management techniques for reading and writing files.

- **Version Control**: Use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to manage document versions and track changes.

- **Text Rendering**: Text layout algorithms for proper alignment and formatting.

- **Formatting**: Apply the Shunting Yard Algorithm for parsing and evaluating expressions.

- **Searching in History**: Utilize hashing techniques to quickly find previous commands or text.

- **Bookmarking**: Implement a linked list to manage bookmarks or highlights in the text.

- **Macro Recording**: Use the Command Pattern for recording and replaying user actions.

- **Drag and Drop**: Collision detection algorithms for effective drag-and-drop functionality.

- **Code Folding**: Implement tree data structures to manage code blocks and allow users to collapse/expand sections.

- **Custom Themes**: Use color schemes and data structures to store user preferences for UI customization.

- **Multi-Document Interface**: Use a tab-based system to manage multiple open documents efficiently, leveraging linked lists or arrays.

- **Collaborative Editing**: Implement algorithms for real-time text syncing between users, potentially using data structures like distributed hash tables.

- **Regular Backups**: Implement a backup system using queues to manage and store versions of documents periodically.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- The editor should handle files of up to [specify size] without lag.
- Search operations should return results in less than [specify time, e.g., 500ms].
